## Introduction

During my internship at Codsoft, I worked on several data science projects that involved real-world data, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms. This repository is a collection of those projects, showcasing my approach to solving data-driven problems and my proficiency in various data science tools and techniques.

## Projects

### 1. TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
- **Description**: This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The goal is to analyze the dataset provided by the Titanic competition on Kaggle and develop a predictive model that can estimate whether a passenger survived based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and fare.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Data Exploration:** Thorough analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand the relationships between different features and survival rates.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Creation and selection of relevant features to improve model performance.
  - **Model Building:** Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict survival.
  - **Evaluation:** Use of performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

- **Results**: 
  - The model demonstrated significant predictive power, with accuracy scores of over X% on the validation set.
  - Insights gained from the analysis highlighted key factors influencing survival rates, such as passenger class and gender.


### 2. MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using machine learning techniques in Python. The objective is to develop a model that can forecast a movie's rating based on various features such as genre, cast, director, and release year, using data from movie datasets.

- **Key Features**: 
  -  **Data Collection:** Utilized movie datasets from sources like IMDb or The Movie Database (TMDb) to gather features relevant to movie ratings.
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Created new features and selected relevant ones to enhance the model’s predictive power.

- **Results**: 
  - The model achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting movie ratings on the test set.
  - Identified key features influencing movie ratings, providing insights into what factors contribute most to a film’s success.

### 3. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
- **Description**: The Iris Flower Classification project involves developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species based on their physical measurements. The dataset used in this project comes from the well-known Iris dataset, which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for different iris species.

- **Key Features**: 
  - **Data Exploration:** Conduct a thorough analysis of the Iris dataset to understand the distribution of features and the relationships between them.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Although the Iris dataset is already well-structured, explore possible feature scaling or transformation to enhance model performance.
  - **Evaluation:** Use performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the effectiveness of each model.

- **Results**: 
  - The models achieved high classification accuracy, often exceeding 95%, demonstrating strong performance in distinguishing between the three iris species.
  - Analysis revealed that petal length and petal width are the most significant features for classifying iris species. Additionally, visualization of the feature relationships helped in understanding how well the different species are separated in the feature space.
